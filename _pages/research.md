* [__"Uniform Inference In High-dimensional Threshold Regression"__](https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Hongqiang_YAN_JMP_Inference_in_High_Dimensional_Threshold.pdf)

This paper addresses statistical inference for high-dimensional threshold regression parameters. I establish oracle inequalities for the scaled Lasso estimator proposed by Lee, Seo, and Shin, assuming only non-subgaussian error terms and covariates. Subsequently, I desparsify (or debias) the scaled Lasso estimator and derive the asymptotic distribution of tests involving an increasing number of slope parameters in the sense of van de Geer et al. (2014). Utilizing these results, I construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the components of the threshold regression slope coefficients. To complement the asymptotic theory in this paper, I conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of our method in finite samples.

* [__"Investigating Integration and Exchange Rate Pass-Through in World Maize Markets Using Post-Selection Inference"__](https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Yan_Goodwin_Caner_Integration _World_Maize_Markets.pdf)  with Barry Goodwin and Mehmet Caner

This paper investigates the extent of market integration in the world markets for maize. To address the shortcomings of existing models on spatial market integration, we adopt an approach towards inference and model selection using the desparsified LASSO method for high-dimensional threshold regression. Our results support the integration of global corn markets, especially when the existence of thresholds is accounted for. We identify important relationships between several variables representing domestic and world economic conditions.
