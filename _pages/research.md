* [__"Uniform Inference for High-dimensional Threshold Regression"__](https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Uniform_Inference_in_High_Dimensional_Threshold_Regression_Models.pdf)

In this paper, we study the scaled Lasso estimator of Lee et al. (2016) for high-dimensional threshold regression models and show how it may be desparsified in the sense of van de Geer et al. (2014) in order to construct asymptotically honest (uniform) confidence intervals. We establish oracle inequalities for the scaled Lasso only assuming non-subgaussian error terms and covariates. Next, we desparsify the scaled Lasso estimator and show how one can conduct uniformly valid inference on the parameters of the model and construct a uniformly valid estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed estimation procedure via Monte Carlo simulations

* [__"Investigating Integration and Exchange Rate Pass-Through in World Maize Markets Using
Inferential LASSO Methods"__] with Barry Goodwin(https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Uniform_Inference_in_High_Dimensional_Threshold_Regression_Models.pdf)

This paper investigates the extent of market integration in the world markets for maize. To address the shortcomings of existing models on spatial market integration, we adopt an approach towards inference and model selection using the desparsified LASSO method for high-dimensional threshold regression. Our results support the integration of global corn markets, especially when the existence of thresholds is accounted for. We identify important relationships between several variables representing domestic and world economic conditions.

* __"Non-parametric Estimation of Risk Preferences"__ with Xiaoyong Zheng and Zheng Li

This paper proposes a nonparametric approach for the estimation of individual producersâ€™ risk preferences and risk premiums when they face uncertainty in both production and price. We allow for the endogenous production inputs within the production function. The framework is proposed for deriving the risk premium function under the expected utility of profit maximization. The econometric model accommodates production risk, price risk, and producer heterogeneity simultaneously. This is done by the series method in the presence of instrumental variables. We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed non-parametric procedure via Monte Carlo simulations.
