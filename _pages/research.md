* [__"Uniform Inference In High-dimensional Threshold Regression"__](https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Hongqiang_YAN_JMP.pdf)

This paper addresses statistical inference for high-dimensional threshold regression parameters. I establish oracle inequalities for the scaled Lasso estimator proposed by Lee, Seo, and Shin, assuming only non-subgaussian error terms and covariates. Subsequently, I desparsify (or debias) the scaled Lasso estimator and derive the asymptotic distribution of tests involving an increasing number of slope parameters in the sense of van de Geer et al. (2014). Utilizing these results, I construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the components of the threshold regression slope coefficients. To complement the asymptotic theory in this paper, I conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of our method in finite samples.

* [__"Investigating Integration and Exchange Rate Pass-Through in World Maize Markets Using Post-Selection Inference"__](https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Yan_Goodwin_Caner_Integration_World_Maize_Markets.pdf)  with Barry Goodwin and Mehmet Caner

This paper investigates the extent of market integration and exchange rate pass-through, as well as market factors that may be associated with deviations from perfect market integration and pass-through. To address the shortcomings of existing models of spatial market integration, we employ procedures outlined in Yan(2023)  for inference and model selection, utilizing the desparsified LASSO method for high-dimensional threshold regression. Our results support the integration of global corn markets, especially when accounting for the existence of thresholds. We identify significant relationships among several variables representing domestic and world economic conditions.
