* __"Uniform Inference for High-dimensional Threshold Regression"__ https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Uniform_Inference_in_High_Dimensional_Threshold_Regression_Models.pdf (Job Market Paper)

In this paper, we study the scaled Lasso estimator of Lee et al. (2016) for high-dimensional threshold regression models and show how it may be desparsified in the sense of van de Geer et al. (2014) in order to construct asymptotically honest (uniform) confidence intervals. We establish oracle inequalities for the scaled Lasso only assuming non-subgaussian error terms and covariates. Next, we desparsify the scaled Lasso estimator and show how one can conduct uniformly valid inference on the slope parameters of the model and construct a uniformly valid estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed estimation procedure via Monte Carlo simulations

* __"High-dimensional Threshold Regression Models of Spatial Market Integration for Building Materials"__ with Barry Goodwin

We develop threshold regression models of price linkages in spatially distinct regional US markets for plywood and lumber products. The models are developed within the framework of high-dimensional threshold regression which is estimated using Lasso methods. The estimates of price changes exhibit substantial nonlinearities. The results are largely consistent with efficiently linked regional markets for lumber and plywood products.

* __"Non-parametric Estimation of Risk Preferences"__ with Xiaoyong Zheng and Zheng Li

This paper proposes a nonparametric approach for the estimation of individual producersâ€™ risk preferences and risk premiums when they face uncertainty in both production and price. We allow for the endogenous production inputs within the production function. The framework is proposed for deriving the risk premium function under the expected utility of profit maximization. The econometric model accommodates production risk, price risk, and producer heterogeneity simultaneously. This is done by the series method in the presence of instrumental variables. We illustrate the usefulness of our proposed non-parametric procedure via Monte Carlo simulations.
