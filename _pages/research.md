* [__"Uniform Inference In High-dimensional Threshold Regression"__](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08105) with Jiatong Li

We develop uniform inference for high-dimensional threshold regression parameters and valid inference for the threshold parameter in this paper. We first establish oracle inequalities for prediction errors and â„“1 estimation errors for the Lasso estimator of the slope parameters and the threshold parameter, allowing for heteroskedastic non-subgaussian error terms and non-subgaussian covariates. Next, we derive the asymptotic distribution of tests involving an increasing number of slope parameters by debiasing (or desparsifying) the scaled Lasso estimator. The asymptotic distribution of tests without the threshold effect is identical to that with a fixed effect. Moreover, we perform valid inference for the threshold parameter using subsampling method. Finally, we conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of our method in finite samples.

* [__"Investigating Integration and Exchange Rate Pass-Through in World Maize Markets Using Post-Selection Inference"__](https://hongqiangyan.github.io/files/Yan_Goodwin_Caner_Integration_World_Maize_Markets.pdf)  with Barry Goodwin and Mehmet Caner

This paper investigates the extent of market integration and exchange rate pass-through, as well as market factors that may be associated with deviations from perfect market integration and pass-through. To address the shortcomings of existing models of spatial market integration, we employ procedures outlined in Yan(2023)  for inference and model selection, utilizing the desparsified LASSO method for high-dimensional threshold regression. Our results support the integration of global corn markets, especially when accounting for the existence of thresholds. We identify significant relationships among several variables representing domestic and world economic conditions.
* [__"The Impact of Soil Erosion on Mean Yields and Yield Risk"__](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/343580?ln=en&v=pdf) with Serkan Aglasan, Le Chen, and Rejesus Roderick
This study investigates the influence of soil erosion on crop yields within the United States (U.S.) using county-level panel data. We first estimate linear panel fixed-effect econometric models to examine the direct impact of two major types of soil erosion (wind and water erosion) on the mean yields of two major crops (soybean and corn), as well as on the higher-order central moments of yields. Although we find that counties with higher levels of soil erosion due to water, wind, or both experience more severe reductions in mean yield, we do not find strong evidence of the yield risk effects of soil erosion. Furthermore, we explore potential nonlinear effects and the presence of multiple unknown breaks in panel data models using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The LASSO method provides additional empirical insights into the nonlinear impact of soil erosion on mean yields, particularly for corn, especially when structural breaks are present. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers seeking to better understand the overall impact of soil erosion on agricultural productivity, and the LASSO approach provides applied economists with a more flexible method to relax the linear constraints in panel data models.
