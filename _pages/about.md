## Welcome!
This is Hongqiang's personal website! 

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [North Carolina State University](https://cals.ncsu.edu/agricultural-and-resource-economics/people/hyan6/)'s persional website!. My field of specialization is econometrics and my research interests in high-dimensional statistical inference. I am especially interested in a high-dimensional regression model with a possible changepoint due to a covariate threshold. In my job market paper, I develop a declassified Lasso estimator for the threshold regression in the high-dimensional regime in order to construct asymptotically uniform confidence intervals for the parameters of interest and hypothesis tests under a sparse setting.

I am on the Job Market for 2022-2023 acaademic year.
