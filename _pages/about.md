This is Hongqiang's personal website! 

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [North Carolina State University](https://cals.ncsu.edu/agricultural-and-resource-economics/people/hyan6/). My field of specialization is econometrics and my research interests in high-dimensional statistical inference. I am especially interested in a high-dimensional regression model with a possible change point due to a covariate threshold. In my working paper, I develop a desparsified Lasso estimator for the threshold regression in the high-dimensional regime in order to construct asymptotically uniform confidence intervals for the parameters of interest and hypothesis tests under a sparse setting.
