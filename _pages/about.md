This is Hongqiang's personal website! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [North Carolina State University](https://cals.ncsu.edu/agricultural-and-resource-economics/people/hyan6/), specializing in econometrics and agricultural economics. My research focuses on high-dimensional statistical inference. In my working paper, I propose the desparsified(or de-biased) Lasso estimation procedure for high-dimensional threshold regression. In addition to my theoretical work, I also utilize the high-dimensional threshold regression model on an empirical study on integration and exchange rate pass-through in world maize markets. In addition to my theoretical work, I have also conducted an empirical study using the high-dimensional threshold regression model to investigate the integration and exchange rate pass-through in world maize markets.
